# Spring Scheduler

---

## ‚è∞ Overview
This document serves as an academic resource and practical guide to **Spring Scheduler**, a core feature of the Spring Framework that enables automated, periodic execution of tasks in Java applications. It is widely used for background processing, such as data synchronization, report generation, and system maintenance.

---

## üìö What is Spring Scheduler?
Spring Scheduler is a lightweight, annotation-driven scheduling framework. It allows developers to schedule tasks using simple annotations, without the need for external job schedulers or complex configurations.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Task Scheduling:** Automate method execution at fixed intervals or specific times.
- **Annotations:** Use `@Scheduled` for scheduling, and `@EnableScheduling` to activate scheduling support.
- **Thread Management:** By default, tasks run on a single thread, but can be configured for concurrent execution.

---

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Automated Task Scheduling:**
  - Use `@Scheduled` to run methods at fixed intervals, delays, or cron expressions.
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Business logic remains in service classes; scheduling logic is managed in dedicated task classes.
- **Flexible Configuration:**
  - Intervals and cron expressions can be set via annotations or external configuration (e.g., `application.yml`).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Scheduled methods can include error handling to ensure robust background processing.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Enable Scheduling:**
   - Add `@EnableScheduling` to a configuration class (e.g., `Config.java`).
2. **Create a Scheduled Task:**
   - Annotate a method with `@Scheduled` in a Spring-managed bean (e.g., `StockTask`).
3. **Configure Intervals:**
   - Use `fixedRate`, `fixedDelay`, or `cron` to control execution timing.
4. **Delegate Business Logic:**
   - Call service methods from scheduled tasks for clean separation.

## üìù Example: Scheduling a Task
```java
// In Config.java
default class Config {
    @EnableScheduling
    // ...other configuration...
}

// In StockTask.java
@Component
public class StockTask {
    private final StockService stockService;

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000) // Runs every 5 seconds
    void scheduleMinReorderLevels() {
        stockService.processMinReorderLevels();
    }
}
```

---

## üïí Scheduling Options
- `fixedRate`: Runs the method at a regular interval (e.g., every 5 seconds).
- `fixedDelay`: Runs the method with a fixed delay after the previous execution finishes.
- `cron`: Uses cron expressions for complex schedules (e.g., every Monday at 8 AM).

**Example:**
```java
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 8 * * MON") // Every Monday at 8:00 AM
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration via application.yml
You can externalize scheduling intervals:
```yaml
myapp.schedule.rate: 10000
```
And reference it:
```java
@Scheduled(fixedRateString = "${myapp.schedule.rate}")
```

## üßë‚Äçüéì Academic Insights
- **Threading:** By default, all scheduled tasks share a single thread. For parallel execution, configure a `TaskScheduler` bean.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep scheduled methods short and non-blocking.
  - Handle exceptions to prevent task termination.
  - Use external configuration for flexibility.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Periodic data cleanup
  - Automated notifications
  - Inventory checks
  - Report generation
